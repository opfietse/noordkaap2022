## Day 13, June 28th 2022, Flåm (N) - Ølberg (N), 418 km, total 7215 km

Today I continue to Voss to have my clutch adjusted. That took place at HMV Maskin. They replaced
the clutch fluid and the clutch feels a bit better now.
The roads are very nice here and lead through a nice environment. Road nr 13 from Røldal in the direction
of Stavanger is nice to ride despite all the tunnels. There are a lot of them but they aren't very long.

The Låtefossen waterfalls are very nice because there is a lot of water coming down in this time of the year.

Stavanger  is the oil capitol of Norway. I took a picture of the oil museum and continued to the memorial
for the accident with the Alexander Kielland oil rig. Spoiler
alert: that accident is dramatised in season 2 of the TV-series "State of Happiness".

Just outside Stavanger I find a campsite in the dunes of Ølberg.
