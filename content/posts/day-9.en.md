## Day 9, June 24th 2022, Innhavet (N) - Tosbotn (N), 476 km, total 5363
Today I continue further south via de E6. Not a very special enviroment today. But there are a lot of
rivers of melting snow, most of the time very spectacular to see.

I passed the Arctic circle again today. I got all touristic and bought some souvenirs and ate a 
reindeer stew.

To avoid a campsite at the E6 again I check Archies. There is a campsite up on the RV 76 in Tosbotn, let's
try that one. It's a beautiful day today and I put up the tent while it's still 21 degrees Celcius and the sun
shines.
I also change the route so I can ride a part of the RV 17 which is supposed to be much nicer to ride than
the E6. We'll check that tomorrow!
