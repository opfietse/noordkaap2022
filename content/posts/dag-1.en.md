## Day 1, June 16th 2022, Assen (NL) - Klippan (S), 761 km, total 761 km
The start of the journey. Mainly on the German Autobahn. It was very busy and there were traffic jams. I just made it
on time to the ferry in Puttgarden. Seeing it from the bright side: I didn't have to wait long for the ferry.

Apart from a small traffic jam near Copenhagen the ride to 'The Bridge' went pretty smooth.
In Sweden it wasn't so busy on the road. I found a campsite in Klippan to put up my tent.
