## Day 1, June 16th 2022, Assen (NL) - Klippan (S), 761 km, total 761 km
The start of the journey. After 5 kilometers I hit the first problem, the powersupply to the Garmin
Zumo 660 fails intermittently. The next days I have this problem which keeps me busy touching the
screen saying I want the Zumo to stay on.

Mainly German Autobahn today. At the first tank stop I see that the carrier ring of the tank bag was very loose! It was
just hanging on with one bolt of the 4 that should hold it. Luckily for me the bolts could not fall out so they were all
still there. 10 minutes of looking for tools and fastening the bolts later I was on my way again.

At the second tank stop I operated the OSCO \... wait, the plunger doesn't return! What is going on? The plastic
tube was too close to the exhaust and has melted so the it was closed! How much trouble can one have
on the first day?

It was very busy and there were traffic jams around Bremen and Hamburg. I just made it
on time to the ferry in Puttgarden. Seeing it all from the bright side: I didn't have to wait long for the ferry.

Apart from a small traffic jam near Copenhagen the ride to 'The Bridge' went pretty smooth.
In Sweden it wasn't so busy on the road and I made good progress. I found a campsite in Klippan to put up my tent.
