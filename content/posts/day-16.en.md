## Day 16, July 1st 2022, Høvåg (N) - Kristiansand (N), 24 km, total 7776 km
Today it's al about catching the ferry to the Netherlands. I start the day slowly and start getting all my stuff
together again. I need to figure out the gear I need on the ferry so I can keep that apart.
After a short I ride I aarive at the check-in. Way on time! I chat a little with some other bikers lined
up to catch the ferry.

The bikes board last and right after the last bike was on board the door closed. After securing the bike
and putting my things in the cabin I went outside and saw that the boat was already sailing!

In the. evening I drank a couple of beers with the bikers I met in the harbor and went to bed a little too late of course.
