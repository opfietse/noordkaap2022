## Day 3, June 18th 2022, Bergsjö (S) - Sandviken (S), 701 km, total 2329 km

In the morning I take a picture of the lake\... the weather doesn’t look that great!

Further north through Sweden, via de E4 along de east coast. I make great progress and stop
somewhere near the Finnish border. Another campsite that is full! So I head back a little to where
I saw a sign ’Stuga’. I arrive at the place of an old man that has indeed a stuga for rent. Toilet and
shower are in his own house\... but hey, that’s okay for now! It is and old stuga but it has
heating and electricity so drying some stuff is possible. It rained for most of the day today.
