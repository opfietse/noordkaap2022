Further north through Sweden, via de E4 along de east coast. I make great progress and stop
Somewhere near the Finnish border. Another campsite that is full! So I head back little to where
I saw a sign ’Stuga’. I arrive at the place of an old man that has indeed a stage for rent. Toilet and
Shower are in disown house … but hey… that’s okay for now! It is and old stage but it has
heating and electricity so drying some stuff is possible. It rained for most of the day today.
