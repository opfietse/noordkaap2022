## Day 2, June 17th 2022, Klippan (S) - Bergsjö (S), 866 km, total 1627 km

I woke up before the alarm clock went off and packing everything up went pretty smooth.
Around 8.15 I am back on the bike, heading back to the motorway. Today it will be only motorways.
Luckily it is way more quiet compared to Germany and I get in the miles quickly. The views are
a bit the same all the time, woods left and right and the occasional lake.

2.5 kilometres before the exit I have to take
it goes wrong\... a small traffic jam because the barrier (a cable barrier, in The Netherlands known as ‘the egg slicer’) between the two lanes was being repaired.

Unfortunately the planned campsite was full, as ws the next one found via Archies. The third one
didn’t do tents but made un exception for me. I could pitch next to a hut. It was late and maybe
staying in the hut was a better option so I opted for that. The campsite was situated at a nice lake.
