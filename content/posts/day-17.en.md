## Day 17, July 2nd 2022, Eemshaven (NL) - Assen (NL), 72 km, total 7848 km
In the mornig when I get outside the island Borkum is the first thing I see. On the
other side of the ferry I can already see Eemshaven.

Today I took the fastest rote from Eemshaven to Assen. Because most of the ferry passengers go via the city of Groningen
that meant that I rode in a big group of motorcycles. I was following the bikers I drank a beer with on the boat.
When I had to go on at some point I had to go in another direction and I waved them goodbye.
