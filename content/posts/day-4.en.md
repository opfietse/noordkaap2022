## Day 4, June 19th 2022, Sandviken (S) - Sevettijärvi (FIN), 606 km, total 2935 km
Today I am entering Finland pretty soon but as I look at the Garmin I am surprised to see that it is already quite late\... only
later I realise that the Garmin is showing Finnish time. Well, I’ll get that hour back tomorrow.
At the Arctic circle near Rovaniemi I see a Yamaha YBR 125 at a gas station. I park my Monster next to it
and get some coffee. While drinking the coffee outside I see the registration plate of the YBR, it’s from Spain.
Soon the owner arrives and he confirms he is from Spain and is on his way to North Cape as well.
We talk a bit and then he sets off. When I finished my coffee I also start riding again. Pretty soon I overtake
the Spaniard who is at the most right side of the road, doing 70 or 80 km/h.

When it is time to look for a place to spend the night I am at a pretty remote road, I haven’t seen
any signs for about 40 km or so. At some point I see some huts next to te road and I stop there. The huts
are not for rent but there is a house I can rent. I took the house, it even had a sauna! And was
situated at a lake. What is more Finnish than cooling down in a lake right after leaving the sauna?
