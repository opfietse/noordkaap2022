Today started with the Trollstigen again, it was very quiet there.

After that I was on my way to Geiranger. Unfortunately it was a bit foggy in that area. That's
why I skipped the detour to Dalsnibba, there wouldn't have been a nice view there.

I visited the stave church in Lom, the second one on my trip. Very nice to see how they built
that church so long ago.

Form Lom I continued on the 55 over de Sgnefjellet. It is a beautiful area but it was raining quite
heavily so I didn't really enjoy it. I also made a little detour via the unpaved Fv471 (Bøverdalen) which
was quite a challenge on de Monster with road tyres. At some point the whole road was submerged in
water. Eventually I ended up on the 55 without crashing the bike.

In Sogndal I looked for a motorcycle or car shop to get my clutch adjusted. I ended up at a VW shop
but they didn't have time for me. They tried to arrange an alternative without succeeding. The best
shot was trying in Voss the next day. When I showed my route on the map I got the suggestion to skip ther
very long Leardal tunnel and tak the mountain pass instead via the Aurlandsfjellet (FV243). That was a
good tip, it was a beautiful road.

I looked for a place to stay in Flåm, I got a room in a hostel, not something I am used to but it was okay.
