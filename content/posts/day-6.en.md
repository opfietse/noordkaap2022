## Day 6, June 21st, Honnigsvåg (N) - Altafjord (N), 333 km, total 3989 km
At 2 o ‘clock the alarm wakes me and I put on my motorcycle gear.
I had parked the bike close to the entrance so I wouldn’t wake up the whole campsite in the middle of the night.

On my way to North Cape!

There is still traffic coming from the Cape, it won’t be busy there I hope?
After 25 km and 3680 km after I left home I am there. I meander between the camper vans and big rocks
and then I am there at the globe. All alone!
On the way up the weather was okay, dry and not too cold. Once on the Cape it started raining and the
wind was even stronger. The tripod with mobile phone just kept standing to take some selfies. The sun is
trying to peek beneath the clouds and partially succeeds in that. It is a nice view.

After half an hour or so I start the bike and go back to the tent. This time I don’t set an alarm clock.

Today the journey ‘back’ starts. After I slept in I slowly packed up my gear.
After riding a bit I see a motorcycle riding at the right most part of the road. It is the same Spaniard
I saw on the Arctic circle in Finland. I slow down and wave at him. He recognises me and stops. He
had also been on the North Cape and was on his way back too.

In Alta I go cultural and go see the rock carvings that are between 2000 and 7000 years old. Quite
Impressive to see. But it rains and I quickly make some photo’s and carry on.
Back on the bike it starts raining harder. I ride on until campsite Altafjord and rent a ‘luxury’ cabin (with shower).
It rains for the rest of the evening.
