## Day 7, June 22nd 2022, Altafjord (N) - Finnjorda (N), 434 km, total 4423 km
The day starts with rain but after a while it gets dry. I see mountains with round shapes, it looks
like have been polished, probably shaped like this through the ages. And also there is still snow
on them. The roads lead along fjords with big rocks on the dry seabed.

Via Tromsø I head towards the ferry to the isle Senja. In Tromsø I have the first roundabout in a tunnel!
After that I continue to the ferry to Senja, 40 minute wait before the ferry leaves to Botnhamn on Senja.

Unfortunately the planned route falls apart because a road is closed. Then let's find a campsite
first, I find a place at the Skoghus in Finnjorda.
