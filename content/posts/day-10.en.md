## Day 10, June 25th 2022, Tosbotn (N) - Orkanger (N), 503 km, total 5866 km
I continue on the RV76, a nice winding road with beautiful sights. After that I get on the RV17, that is the well
known north/south road when you don't want to take the E6. The sights alternate between fjords and
mountain landscapes (like Switzerland?). A very nice road.

At Breksted I have to take another ferry, I decide to look for a campsite before I take the ferry for a change. I quickly
found one but it was very busy\... okay, then take the ferry anyway.
The first campsite across the water also was very busy, at the second one, Geita camp in Orkanger, I found a place for
the tent. But that campsite also was full of regulars (caravans completly built in with wooden structures). Apperently
the area has lots of campsites with mostly regular visitors.
