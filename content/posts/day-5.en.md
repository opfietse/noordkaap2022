## Day 5, June 20th 2022, Sevettijärvi (FIN) - Honnigsvåg (N), 719 km, total 3655 km
Early rising again, today it goes into Norway. That isn’t very far from where I am but I want to make
some progress. Once in Norway the roads instantly start winding, that’s a nice change to all the
straight roads I had so far. I also see the first river of all the water from melting snow.

First the trip goes to Grense Jacobselv, that is in the north eastern point of Norway, against the
Russian border. I had looked it up on Google streetview and saw there were a lot of camper vans there.
Up until the last bend I thought they wouldn’t be there\... but there they were!

After taking the usual pictures and talking to some German bikers that spent the night there I headed
west. I didn’t ’t know how far I would get in the direction of the North Cape but my plan was to be there
Very early in the morning. According to the Garmin I should be able to be there around 9 pm, that
Made made decide to go for it and camp at Nordcapp Camping in Honnigsvåg, about 25 km from the North Cape.
I take the FV98, E6 and E69 to Honnigsvåg. I quickly put up the tent, set the alarm at 2 am and go to sleep.
