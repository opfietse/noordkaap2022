## Dag 11, June 26th 2022, Orkanger (N) - Åndalsnes (N), 515 km, total 6381 km
Today the journey continues via the Atlantic Road and the Trollstigen. The day starts with a nice winding
road. And of course there is a ferry crossing as well.

The closer I get to the Atlantic Road the more boring the roads get. Let's make a detour to Kvernes, there
is a stave church.

The Atlantic Road is very beautiful but not spectacular to ride. I went over it, went back and went over
it agan, that way I could look for a good photo place.

Then continue to the Trollstigen. Luckily it wasn't very busy. It was quite spectacular with all the
waterfalls. But that also resulted in some wet hairpin bends. I rode past the visiters center and
continued for a couple of kilometers through a white landscape. After that I turned around and did
the way down on the Trollstigen.

Time to look for a campsite. I ended up on Sogge bru where I rented a cabin.
