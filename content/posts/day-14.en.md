## Day 14, June 29th 2022, Ølberg (N) - Høvåg (N), 409 km, total 7625 km

Beautiful roads again today. Especially the last part of the road to Lysebotn is very spectactular with
more than 20 hairpins in a very short distance. If you don't take the ferry you have to go back the same way, which
I did. This road is much more challenging than the Trollstigen!
Also the landscape is very beautiful with a lot of big, more or less round shaped rocks.

A little bit further road 42 in the direction of Evje was very nice to ride.
I found a campsite near Høvåg.
