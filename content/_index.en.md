## North Cape by motorcycle
In june 2022 I am going to the North Cape by motorcycle.

The route
will go via Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland to Norway. I think
I'll need 6 days for that. For the journey back along Norways coast I reserved another 10 days.
The first part of the journey will be mainly motorways (Germany, Puttgarden-RÃ¸dby, via "The bridge" to Sweden).
Luckilly for me by the time I am in Norway there will be a new ferry sailing from Kristiansand to Eemshaven.
I booked this ferry for the return trip, that will safe me a 1000 or so boring motorway kilometres.
