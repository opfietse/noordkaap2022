## North Cape by motorcycle
In june 2022 I am going to the North Cape by motorcycle.

The route
will go via Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Finland to Norway. I think
I'll need 6 days for that.
The first part of the journey will be mainly motorways (Germany, Puttgarden-RÃ¸dby, via "The bridge" to Sweden).
After that the journey continues into Finland and Norway (if all goes well I'll even visit Grense Jacobselv)
and eventually the North Cape.

For the journey back along Norways coast I reserved another 10 days. By than the fjords will come into sigth and
as well as the other natura;l beaty Norway as to offer.
Luckilly for me by the time I am in Norway there will be a new ferry sailing from Kristiansand (N) to Eemshaven (NL).
I booked this ferry for the return trip, that will safe me a 1000 or so boring motorway kilometres.
